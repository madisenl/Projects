    "Our dataset is from the University of Portsmouth collected and curated by Dr. Joe Cox. This dataset focuses on video games and their statistics, containing data about the sales, gameplay characteristics, and playtime of over a thousand video games released between 2004 and 2010. The original dataset was used to provide insights into the factors that contribute to a video game becoming a blockbuster. Playtime data was collected via crowd sourcing. The dataset contains 1770 instances (rows) of games and 166 columns, each column recording the characteristics of each video game and the block-buster (sales) title each game achieved (if achieved). Our dataset represents a sample rather than a complete population. Due to the fact that the video game industry is vast and constantly evolving, our dataset only contains data within a specific time frame (2004 - 2010). It would be very challenging to collect data on every single game ever made. Our population of interest is all action games released between 2004 - 2010 across multiple gaming platforms. Because our dataset represents only a sample of video games, it would be best to take a random sample from all of the action video games we have so that our results are representative, generalizable and void of any potential biases.\n",
    "For our analysis we would like to examine the characteristics that contribute to a video game getting blockbuster status. To do so we aim to answer these questions: Is the proportion of action games that achieve Block0.5 status significantly less than 20%? & What are the mean and median sale amounts of action games that achieve blockbuster(0.5) status compared to those that do not?\n",
    "It can be extremely difficult to develop a game and it be successful. The gaming industry is very competitive and is evolving fast, so it is important for developers, publishers, platform holders, and investors to understand the factors that contribute to a game's success. Action games are one of the most popular gaming genres and they represent a large portion of the gaming market. The answers to our research questions could provide valuable insights that could impact decision-making across the industry. By providing data-driven insights into how specific factors contribute to a games success we can provide developers, publishers, platform holders, and investors with a blueprint for creating successful video games. Our research questions have the potential to influence which specific characteristics are incorporated into games, investment strategies for action games, identify how different characteristics incorporated into games perform on specific consoles, and overall how to combine all factors to create more successful action games."

Our distribution also appears to be normal, which reaffirms the appropriate measure of center to be the mean.\n",

This small p-value suggests that it is very unlikely that our sample result occurred due to chance. The significance level, set at 0.10, represents the threshold against which we compare the p-value to determine whether the observed result is statistically significant.

    "Our results indicate that the proportion of successful action games (Block0.5 == True) is not significantly less than 20%, and the true proportion lies within the confidence interval [0.2193, 0.2602]. Additionally, we investigated the mean and median sale amounts of action games based on their blockbuster status. Action games that achieved Block0.5 status had a mean sale amount of 1.625 million and a median sale amount of  1.060 million, both of which were significantly higher than those that did not achieve Blockbuster status. This highlights the association between financial success and achieving blockbuster status in the gaming industry. For our hypothesis test, we aimed to determine whether the proportion of action games achieving Block0.5 status was less than 20%. We conducted a data cleaning process to ensure the dataset was clean, we converted boolean values and checked for missing and unusual values. Using a sample of 1076 action games, we calculated an observed proportion of 0.24 and performed a hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.10. The resulting p-value of 0.0022 led us to reject the null hypothesis, indicating strong evidence that the proportion of action games achieving Block0.5 status is greater than 20%. Additionally, we found that action games with Block0.5 status had significantly higher average and median sales compared to all action games, highlighting the association between success and achieving blockbuster status.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encountered some limitations during our analysis. While our dataset was comprehensive, it is possible that it does not capture all factors influencing blockbuster status, such like marketing or player demographics. The reliance on sales as a measure of success might overlook other factors of game performance, like acclaim or player engagement. Furthermore, the dataset only included specific consoles which does not fully represent the entire market of gaming. These limitations are important to keep in mind when generalizing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could be done to explore more questions and conduct further analyses to build on our findings. One idea is examining the impact of specific game features or genres on achieving blockbuster status to closer identify predictors of success. As well, expanding the dataset to include more diverse consoles and international games could enhance the generalizability of results and offer a more precise understanding of what determines blockbuster success in the gaming industry.."
